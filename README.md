[Live demo](https://yurkagon.github.io/Doom-Nukem-CSS/)

Its not playable like a normal game, the whole level is empty but anyway I guess it should be an interesting thing :)

## Features

- Doom-like menu ðŸ˜Ž
- Camera
- Player movement
- Levels
- Collision (for player or enemies)
- Sprites
- Enemies
- Weapons (only 2 ones: pistol and shotgun)
- Shooting
- Health
- Night level

## Technologies used

The Doom like menu is built by React

To manipulate with the 3D level I use only JQuery

### Rendering

Everything you see is built by HTML5 \<div>
